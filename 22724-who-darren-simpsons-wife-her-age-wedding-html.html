He is a funny, likable guy and that is why of late, some of his fans have been asking,” who is Darren Simpson’s wife?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/397ffd66223e03af.jpg><h2>Quick notes about Samantha Simpson</h2><ul><li>Darren Simpson wife's age : 32</li><li>Husband: Darren Whackhead Simpson</li><li>Kids : Nate and Cruz</li><li>Occupation: Founder of Simpsons Little Learners Academy</li></ul><h2>How it all started with Whackhead</h2><p class=align-left>Samantha and Darren first met just after midnight while enjoying their holidays in a smoky Ballito nightclub. "By this time, none of us was intent on getting into a relationship but once my eyes landed on her, I could not resist her charm offensive, and I wanted to see her again and again". Said, Darren</p><p class=align-left>After chatting through the entire night, Darren had no doubt that Samantha was the “Miss charming” he had been expecting all along.</p><p class=align-left>Samantha was simply blown away by the classic proposal made by her boyfriend in February 2010. To create a surprise , Darren invited her to dinner and asked her to dress well because it was going to be a special treat. “His request for me to look nice made me feel funny because we just used to hang out in ordinary restaurants”. She said</p><p class=align-left>Samantha’s mind started racing when she saw him driving into the prestigious Westcliff Hotel. As earlier mentioned, she was not used to checking into such high-end joints and so her heartbeat went a notch higher. But the surprises had just begun. After taking their table, she noticed some members of her favorite band, The Parlotones sitting right next to them.</p><p class=align-left>“Dress well, at the Westcliff Hotel, and now sitting next to Parloton band crew? What’s going on?” thought Samantha.</p><p class=align-left>After a reasonable pause, Darren alerted Kahn Morbee who was the lead vocalist and in a quick turn of events, the boys pulled out their hidden guitars and sang the beautiful proposal song to her. She felt totally in love and inseparable with Darren three years after meeting him “Wow! There were tears in eyes as I saw Darren go down on his knee to ask the million dollar question” said Samantha</p><h2>The wedding day</h2><p class=align-left>Most men are known to be courageous and fearless, but this credit only applies until the day one is having their wedding. Samantha and Darren's wedding was supposed to begin a few minutes before 2 pm on September 25th 2010. Thankfully, the guests had already filled the magnificent stone chapel by now and this made the bridegroom really nervous. "Is she really coming or has she changed her mind?" are some of the questions that seemed to be running through his mind. Darren was fidgeting because the wedding was supposed to have begun thirty minutes earlier yet by this time, there was no sign of Samantha or the presiding Church minister.</p><p class=align-left>Just before his tension hit fever proportions, Clive Johnson, the Church minister arrived and shortly thereafter, Samantha the bride was also ushered into the Church to thunderous applause.</p><p class=align-left>Samantha and Darren (then aged 24 and 33 respectively) chose to tie the knot at seaside because that’s where their love story had started slightly back in December 2007.</p><h2>Being Whackhead Simpson’s wife</h2><p class=align-left>Samantha proudly refers to herself as “wife of my gorgeous husband” a loving introduction on the social media account Twitter.</p><p class=align-left>Darren and Samantha Simpson now have two children with whom they live in Johannesburg, South Africa.
