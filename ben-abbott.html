He gained his inspiration from the swords he had seen in museums and castles across England.</p><p>He has a family that supports his passion for the skill. Ben also has two siblings; brother Rich Abbott and sister Janis Abbott. Furthermore, it is said that it was Ben’s father who helped him learn to craft metals during his early days.</p><p>Abbott tried to craft his first sword at the young age of 13. He was fascinated by the swords and weaponry that he saw in the museums and castles, and after figuring out that he couldn’t buy a sword, he subsequently decided to make one for himself.</p><p>The young aspirant’s attempts failed as sword-making isn’t child’s play. Nevertheless, little Ben did not give up on his passion entirely and decided to scale things back a little and start by crafting small knives instead as a&nbsp; beginner.</p><p>Thus, at 17, he started making his own knife and began practicing the art of crafting metal. He also made jewelry, ornaments, and small blades during his practice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ben-brother-Rich-Abbott-with-their-father-Peter.jpg><p>Ben’s mother, Renee Abbott, passed away on December 16, 2013.

He resides in Richmond, VA, as of now. Ben Abbott’s age is 49 years. His height and weight aren’t disclosed yet.</p><p>He is originally from England and was born there. He later came to America and developed a keen interest in crafting blades that he displayed starting from a young age.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=educational-background>Educational background</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ben-with-his-sister-Janis-Abbott.jpg><p>Ben graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a degree in electrical engineering</a>. Similarly, he also has a degree in anthropology from Binghamton University. Therefore, we can understand that Ben is well-educated.</p><p>However, when it came to craftsmanship, he was his own teacher. Apparently, he didn’t have a master and learned the art by himself.</p><p>The internet wasn’t prevalent during his learning years. So, he had to rely on books from the local library and research intensively about mastering the skillset’s details and procedures.</p><p>After many attempts, Ben finally started getting familiar with the process. First, he would have to meet the local bladesmiths for advice. Even though he didn’t have quality equipment and machinery, he managed to do whatever he had at hand and continued to practice.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=is-ben-abbott-from-forged-in-fire-married>Is Ben Abbott from Forged in Fire married?</h2><p>Ben Abbott is currently in a relationship with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">choreographer</a> Heather Rabun.

Then, in around 2000, he worked as an electrical engineer at the California Institute of Technology.</p><p>He was also working as a part of the group of scientists who were working on LIGO. It is a highly technical apparatus and physical experiment studying gravitational waves and developing observations as an astronomical tool.</p><p>LIGO is the world’s largest gravitational wave observatory. Ben had, in fact, volunteered to teach metal works in the project, but he reportedly left the venture to participate in Forged in Fire. He now pursues the work of forging metal, blades, jewelry, ornaments, and knives through his personal business venture.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=what-forged-in-fire-is-all-about>What “Forged in Fire” is all about?</h3><p>Forged in Fire is an American reality series that airs on the History channel.
