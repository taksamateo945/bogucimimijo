They were really struggling.”</p><p>Gifford then added with a laugh, “I want that money back!”</p><p>The friendship between Gifford and Jenner dates back to the 1970s when they both lived in California, and the two women have remained close. Back in 2015, when Jenner’s husband transitioned into a woman, Caitlyn, Gifford told viewers that Kris was doing her best to get her act together and be a good friend, and it was a complicated situation that it is difficult to comprehend.</p><p>Kris was married to attorney Robert Kardashian before she married her second husband, then known as Bruce. Kardashian passed away in 2003, and Kris has said that when she was a single mom she didn’t have anything. She remembers going to the market and when her credit card didn’t work she thought, “I can’t even buy a tomato.”</p><p>Thanks to her serious momager skills, Kris is now a millionaire and has plenty of money to pay Gifford back.

Gifford is beginning a new chapter in her life, and the 65-year-old recently revealed that she is ready to start dating again.</p><p>Gifford’s husband, Frank, passed away in 2015 at the age of 84, and Kathie Lee says that she had a great love in her life, but she is open to finding love again. She says it can come at any time, and just because she had one great love, it doesn’t mean she can’t have another.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Kathie Lee Gifford’s last day on the Today Show will be Friday, April 5th.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeblsGptcRmo56dXZy2p7LOq5tmpZGgsrR5zKipnmWjnbykt8innmaqlauyra3Toqanq12WwG6%2Fx55kqaqVpa6zsdJmq6hlnJqut7GMraadmalif3eAk3BnaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./know-about-got-liam-cunningham-wife-height-net-worth-age.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Know About GOT Liam Cunningham; Wife, Height, Net Worth, Age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./big-bang-theory-star-alice-amter-in-workout-gear-is-a-queen.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Big Bang Theory Star Alice Amter in Workout Gear is a &amp;quot;Queen&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-todd-chrisley-gay-everything-about-his-sexuality.html>Is Todd Chrisley Gay?
