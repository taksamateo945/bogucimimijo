He also does not have kids yet. The Superman actor has dated several popular women over the years and is currently in a relationship with Natalie Viscuso.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Unless you have completely ignored everything Hollywood in the last two decades, you should be familiar with Henry Cavil and his career exploits. The British actor is best known for portraying the DC Comics character, Superman. He is also celebrated for his roles as Sherlock Holmes in Enola Holmes and its 2022 sequel, Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher, and Charles Brandon in The Tudors. His love life has always been religiously followed and at the moment, it revolves around Natalie Viscuso.</p><h2><strong>Henry Cavill is Not Married and Does Not Have a Wife</strong></h2><p>The Superman actor is not a married man and has never been. As far as the public knows, Henry Cavill is yet to exchange marital vows with anyone. However, people continue to make speculations about his marital status.</p><p>For instance, those who haven’t closely followed his career and personal life often assume he is married and a family man. Given the age of the British actor, this is understandable but the fact remains that he does not have a wife.</p><p>The fact that he has never been married partly fuels the massive interest in his love life, which in turn, inspires several conjectures about his being unmarried. At some point, it was rumored that the actor was gay. This was after photos of him with a guy named Corie Spears circulated online. However, it was later discovered that even though Corie Spears is gay, he is only an old friend of Cavil.</p><h2><strong>Who is Henry Cavill’s Girlfriend?</strong></h2><p>Henry Cavill is currently dating a woman named Natalie Viscuso. While he has never been married, the Superman actor has had relationships with several famous women, including the likes of Kaley Cuoco. His first known relationship was in 2009 when he was romantically linked to championship horse jumper, Ellen Whitaker. With her, the famous actor came close to getting married.</p><p>Henry Cavill proposed to Whitaker in May 2011 and they got engaged. However, they never get to exchange marital vows as they amicably called off their engagement in August 2012. That same year, he began dating The Mandalorian alum, Gina Carano. Several months into the relationship, they broke up only to reignite their romance in October 2013. It seems the relationship wasn’t meant to be as they parted ways for good in December 2014.</p><p>After Carano, Henry Cavill dated Kaley Cuoco in the summer of 2013. But the relationship was more of a fling as it lasted barely over a week. Next in line was a college student named Tara King. Cavill faced some backlash as he was 13 years older than King who was only 19 years old when they dated. The relationship came to light in February 2016 and it seems it ended that year as well. The Superman actor also dated Lucy Cork, a stuntwoman he met on the set of Mission: Impossible – Fallout. The relationship lasted for roughly a year.</p><h2><strong>What Does Henry Cavill’s Current Girlfriend Natalie Viscuso Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>The famous actor has been dating Natalie Viscuso for about a year and six months as of this writing. Although Natalie is not as famous as Henry Cavill, she is a familiar face in Hollywood. Back in 2005, her 16th birthday party was featured in an episode of the popular MTV series, My Super Sweet 16. She was portrayed in the series as a kid from a rich home, living in a $5 million home and driving around town with her father’s exotic cars.</p><p>Apart from that, Natalie Viscuso now works as a Hollywood executive. From whaG we gathered, she currently works as the Vice President of TV at Vertigo Entertainment, a film and television production company founded in 2001 by Roy Lee and Dough Davison. Before this, she worked for Legendary Entertainment, also as Vice President of TV and digital studio. Thomas Tull founded the film production and mass media company in 2000.</p><h3><strong>When Did Henry Cavill and Natalie Viscuso go Red Carpet Official?</strong></h3><p>The Superman actor and his girlfriend went red carpet official in October 2022. Henry Cavill and Natalie Viscuso posed together on the red carpet on the 27th of the aforementioned month. This was during the premiere of&nbsp;Enola Holmes 2&nbsp;which they attended together. It was a significant moment for their relationship as it marked their first joint appearance in an event.</p><p>Although there had been rumors that the two were dating, it was confirmed in April 2021 when they went Instagram official. Both Cavil and Viscuso shared the same picture that depicts them playing chess on their respective Instagram pages. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Henry’s caption on the picture</a> which read, “This is me looking quietly confident shortly before my beautiful and brilliant love Natalie, destroys me at chess,” clearly indicated that there was more to them than just friendship.</p><p>Apparently, some fans and followers of Henry Cavill weren’t too happy about the actor’s relationship with Natalie Viscuso. They took to social media platforms to belittle the relationship with hurtful words. The Superman actor had to address the situation in quite a lengthy <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>write-up shared on his social media pages</a>.</p><h3><strong>Does Henry Cavill Have Children?</strong></h3><p>The famous actor is yet to become a father. His family life continues to revolve around the family he was born into. It is no secret that Henry has four brothers. He is the fourth of five male children born to his parents, Marianne Dalgliesh and Colin Cavill.</p><p>His mother is of Scottish, English, and Irish descent and used to work as a secretary in a bank. His father, on the other hand, was born in Chester, England, and used to work as a stockbroker. Piers Cavill and Niki Richard Dalgliesh Cavill are the eldest of his four brothers. The third brother who happens to be Henry’s immediate older brother is Simon Cavill. Charles Cavill is the youngest of the brothers and the only younger brother the actor has.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmoqtdnbKvvthmmpqumaG5brnAq6minZRirq24jJqZqK2kYrWqv4ywoJ%2BdXaC2pb%2BMoKCrpJantqa6w6xkmqaUYrOiucilsGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./source-of-tofu-and-tempeh-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Source of tofu and tempeh</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./a-need-for-speed-racing-on-the-tomorrowland-speedway.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Need for Speed: Racing on the Tomorrowland Speedway</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-todd-chrisley-gay-everything-about-his-sexuality.html>Is Todd Chrisley Gay?
