"That's something that we're doing different this year, so that's something that I've been doing in the offseason."</p><p>Achane appeared in 11 games as a rookie and rushed for 800 yards and eight touchdowns on 103 carries, averaging 7.8 yards per rush. He also made an impact in the passing game, hauling in 27 catches for 197 yards and three more scores.</p>King of Phinlandüê¨üëë <span class=acct>@KingOfPhinland</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mike McDaniel on De'Von Achane year 2:&lt;br>&lt;br>"The more he can understand within the offense the more ways he can get the ball. He feels that there's more out there from the opportunities he had last year. I've seen some strength gains and you can tell by his body he's put some work‚Ä¶ &lt;a href="https://t.co/P7bwo3BY6W">pic.twitter.com/P7bwo3BY6W&lt;/a></p><p>Per Pro Football Focus, Achane lined up in the slot or out wide on 100 out of his 300 snaps in 2023, the second-highest percentage among running backs with 50 or more carries. The 22-year-old added that he's worked with Miami's talented crop of receivers like Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle to sharpen his catching skills.</p><p>"I got some of the best receivers in the room here," Achane said. "During OTAs, I was going out there running routes with them when they weren't here. I did that with them. Basically, why not? Our receiver room is one of the greatest, and if I want to do the stuff they want me to do, might as well take tips and learn from them."</p><p>Fantasy owners should expect a big year out of Achane, as he has the skills to be one of the best sources of production at the running back position. It's safe to say that he should be targeted early in fantasy drafts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmp%2BeoKMn5inrJGoxm6ty56prWWUpLmxtMinqmaclau8r3nAnJ%2BappVivbOxz5qpoqaXYsGwecaeq2aln6eybr%2FNmqesZZGperi%2BjKKlZmpgZ4E%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-francis-girlfriend-abbey-wilson-gives-birth-to-twins-2014710.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joe Francis' Girlfriend Abbey Wilson Gives Birth to Twins</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aidan-gallagher-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Aerialist Aidan Bryant -Winner Of Americas Got Talent All-Stars 2023</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-todd-chrisley-gay-everything-about-his-sexuality.html>Is Todd Chrisley Gay?
