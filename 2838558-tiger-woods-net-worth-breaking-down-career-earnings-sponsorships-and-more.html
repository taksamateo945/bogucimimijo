That excellence has resulted in several streams of revenue for the 15-time major winner. From endorsement deals to course-design fees, he's grossed more than $1 billion in his life.</p><p>Woods' victory at the 2019 Masters announced his return as a competitor in majors, but he never left the earnings scene.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Career Earnings and Net Worth</strong></p><p>While the sport has existed for hundreds of years, prize money skyrocketed as Tiger increased the game's popularity. He wasn't the only reason for the late-'90s spike<span>―</span>television revenue was the biggest factor<span>―</span>but his superstardom attracted more viewers to golf.</p><p>And he certainly profited from that.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PGA Tour</a>'s&nbsp;leaderboard, Woods has totaled more than $118 million in career earnings. He's the only golfer to crack the $100 million mark, which he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">achieved</a> in 2012.</p><p>In December 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kurt Badenhausen</a> of Forbes pegged Tiger's estimated net worth at $800 million. Plus, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Sirak</a> of Golf Digest, Woods has a PGA Tour pension plan of more than $20 million.</p><p>Woods also earns money through a golf-course design business. Most recently, it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> he will create the North Course at Makaha Valley Resort in Oahu, Hawaii.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Endorsement Deals</strong></p><p>Early in his career, Woods' endorsements featured AT&T, Gatorade, General Motors, Gillette, Nike and Tag Heuer, among others.</p><p>After his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple extramarital affairs</a> and 45-day stay at an in-patient therapy program became public in 2009, all of those companies but Nike eventually dropped him.</p><p>Woods has signed four contracts with Nike, dating back to a five-year, $40 million deal in 1996 before his professional debut. He then inked a $100 million extension before signing two deals of undisclosed amounts, though the most recent is believed to be worth $200 million, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cork Gaines and Meredith Cash</a> of Business Insider.</p><p>Along the way, he's appeared in several commercials for the brand.</p><p>Although Nike stopped producing golf equipment in 2016, the company still provides apparel, gloves and shoes for Woods. He now uses TaylorMade clubs and Bridgestone golf balls.</p><p>Tiger's current <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sponsors</a> include Monster Energy, Upper Deck, Hero MotoCorp and Japanese pain-relief company Kowa.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Community Impact</strong></p><p>Together with his father, Earl Woods, Tiger established the Tiger Woods Foundation<span>―</span>now known as the TGR Foundation<span>―</span>in 1996. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stated mission</a> of the organization is to "empower students to pursue their passions through education."</p><p>The foundation owns a 35,000-square foot education facility in Orange County, California, called the Tiger Woods Learning Center. The TGR EDU: Explore program has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">served</a> 625,000 students.</p>Tiger Woods <span class=acct>@TigerWoods</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Scholars from around the country are at the TGR Learning Lab today.

"It's just an expression of me.
