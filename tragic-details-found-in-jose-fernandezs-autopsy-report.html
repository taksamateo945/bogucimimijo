All three young men were dead; two were found underneath the boat, while one was in the water. Fernández, per <a href=# rel=noopener>NBC Miami</a>, was only 24 years old and had recently announced that he and his girlfriend were expecting their first child. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission surmised that speed had caused the accident. They noted that Fernández had died from trauma.</p><p dir=ltr>His autopsy, however, revealed that there was more to the story. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>USA Today</a>, Fernández had both cocaine and alcohol in his system. Blood taken from a vein and eye determined that his blood alcohol level was .147, which NBC News writes is almost twice the legal limit. Macias and Rivero were not legally drunk. Furthermore, Fernández and his friends all died from blunt force trauma. His <a href=# rel=noopener>autopsy report</a> stated that his injuries included lacerations on his right eye, his right cheek, mouth, lip, and chin.</p><p>Additionally, Fernández had various broken bones in his face including the mandible, maxilla, and zygomatic bone. The autopsy concluded that he had cerebral edema and a subgaleal hemorrhage (via USA Today). In other words, Fernández’s brain had swelled and his skull was internally bleeding. He also suffered pulmonary edema, or fluid build-up in the lungs (per <a href=# rel=noopener>Mayo Clinic</a>) from the impact. Nevertheless, the report failed to mention who was actually driving the boat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKeuqLXCZpuerJGeubR5xaisp5xdnrtuts6snGaelae7orrDnrGsZZGqwbC80rJkq52gpL%2B1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./johnny-bliss.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Johnny Bliss - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marshall-faulk.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Marshall Faulk Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-todd-chrisley-gay-everything-about-his-sexuality.html>Is Todd Chrisley Gay?
