On the morning of July 10, 2003, Tim Schuster was supposed to meet with a co-worker for breakfast, but had apparently missed the appointment. Later that day, he was supposed to retrieve his son from Larissa, but he never showed up. Larissa immediately became the prime suspect in her estranged husband’s disappearance. She was initially interviewed by the Clovis Police Department, but was not charged. Despite her husband being missing, Larissa and her son took a planned vacation to Disney World and then to Missouri. In the meantime, police interviewed Larissa’s co-worker James Fagone, who was more forthcoming in his interrogation.</p><p>Larissa Schuster’s murder trial began on October 22, 2007, more than four years after she was charged. Her trial had to be moved from Clovis, California to Los Angeles due to the pre-trial publicity. She had been dubbed the “Acid Lady” by various media outlets in Fresno. Prosecutors had alleged to the jury that Larissa Schuster had attempted to solicit Tim’s murder before, believing that she could get away with it. They also played graphic and berating phone messages from Larissa that Tim had saved on his answering machine. Prosecutors also stated how Larissa had access to all the chemicals used in the murder, being that she was a biochemist in a research lab.</p><p>Due to the special circumstance finding, Larissa Schuster was mandatorily sentenced to life without parole on May 16, 2008. At her sentencing hearing, her daughter Kristin gave a victim’s impact statement: “You’ve given up all rights as a mother, wife, daughter, friend and woman. You’re a disgrace to this family – a pitiful excuse for a human. I pray you’re continually haunted at night by the sight and sound of my father fighting for his last breathing moments on this earth. I hope you toss and turn and have horrible nightmares visualizing the horrific act of violence you have committed.”</p><p align=justify>During his police interrogation, James Fagone revealed that he and Larissa Schuster were responsible for the disappearance and murder of Timothy Schuster. James admitted that on the night of July 9, 2003, he and Larissa lured Tim from his home. The pair then used chloroform and a stun gun to incapacitate Tim, then disposed of his unconscious body in a 55-gallon barrel, and attempted to dissolve his body with hydrochloric acid. With a search warrant, police searched Larissa Schuster’s storage unit where they found the barrel with the liquefied remains of her husband. Larissa Schuster was arrested for first-degree murder at the St. Louis Airport.</p><p align=justify>By 2001, the Schuster marriage had deteriorated. In February 2002, Larissa filed for divorce, which would prove to be acrimonious. Larissa and Tim fought over custody of their son Tyler and the splitting of their joint assets. Larissa was eventually awarded primary custody of Tyler and was allowed to stay in the couple’s house. Tim moved out into a condominium, but in August 2002, Larissa and her lab assistant James Fagone broke into Tim’s home to retrieve some of her belongings. Larissa reportedly stated to her friend, Terri Lopez: “Well, I want [my husband] dead. You don’t understand. I could do it and get away with it.”</p><p align=justify>James Fagone, who had also been charged with first-degree murder as well as kidnapping, went to trial in November 2006. His defense was that Larissa Schuster was the mastermind of Timothy Schuster’s murder, and that he only acted as an accessory to murder after the fact under duress, maintaining that Larissa had threatened his life. Defense testimony came from James’ friends, co-workers, and Larissa’s friend Terri Lopez, all of whom stated that Larissa was a very controlling and forceful person. However, James had already confessed to the crime, which he had unsuccessfully tried to recant. Jurors were shown the video of James’ police interrogation, where he is shown saying: “I held the barrel for her, put him in, poured all the solution and she like couldn’t stand it. So she said, put it on, the lid on. So I helped her put the lid on and she put it in the shed.” Although James Fagone was acquitted of kidnapping, he was found guilty of first-degree murder, and despite jurors’ pleas for leniency, he was sentenced to life without parole.</p><h2>Larissa Schuster Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Larissa is one of the <strong>richest Biochemist</strong> from United States.
