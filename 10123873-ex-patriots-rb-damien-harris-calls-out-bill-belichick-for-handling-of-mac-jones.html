He's a first round pick, but as long as you teach him what I say, everything gonna be fine.' S--t wasn't fine. Now Mac Jones is in Jacksonville," Harris said, claiming that Belichick was the "only reason" Jones didn't work out.</p><p>The 27-year-old was drafted by the Patriots in the third round of the 2019 NFL draft, starting 34 games for the team over four years. Harris explained that his issues with Belichick stemmed from his decision to sign Cam Newton in 2020.</p><p>"I think that started kinda was this Cam Newton situation… everybody was like, 'What the f--k is this? Why Cam Newton?' Bill thought that he could make it work," Harris said. "It didn't really work."</p><p>Harris also detailed the lack of communication that New England's players had with Belichick during his time with the organization.</p><p>"If anybody had anything to say about it, it was [met with] a very, very quick, swift, 'Shut the f--k up. I know what I'm doing.' And that's it," he said (h/t <a href=# rel=noopener>Chad Graff</a> of The Athletic).</p><p>After the Patriots selected Jones with a first-round pick in 2021, he went on to earn a Pro Bowl nod as a rookie and lead New England to a playoff appearance. However, his production steadily declined in the two ensuing years before he was <a href=# rel=noopener>traded</a> to the Jacksonville Jaguars for a sixth-round pick on March 10.</p><p>Belichick's time with the organization had already concluded at that time, as the Patriots parted ways with him on Jan. 11.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmiFeH%2BMnq9mqJGpv6q706xkq5pdma6utcSnZKGZoqe2tHnCmqOlq12kwrV5waKjpWWSmrmqr8eimqRllqS%2FbrTAp5uloZ6cerCyjKaYnGWapLumv56rnJ91paXAtb7AnKtnm5%2Bi</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-lochte-apologizes-for-controversial-post-beijing-interview-201229.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Lochte Apologizes for Controversial Post-Beijing Interview</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./todd-tuckers-latest-video-has-fans-laughing-in-the-comments-435284.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Todd Tuckers Latest Video Has Fans Laughing In The Comments</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-todd-chrisley-gay-everything-about-his-sexuality.html>Is Todd Chrisley Gay?
