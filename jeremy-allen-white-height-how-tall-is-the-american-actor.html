Jeremy Allen White’s height is 5 feet 7 inches which is the same as 170 cm or 1.7 meters. The New York-born actor falls short of the average height for males in America by two inches, but what he lacks in height is fully made up by his personality.</strong></p><p>Jeremy has played some really remarkable roles in the course of his career, and a good example is depicting the character of Phillip “Lip” Gallagher in Shameless. From what is obvious, the New Yorker wasn’t the tallest actor in the series, but that did not stop him from essaying his “Lip” role to perfection.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Jeremy Allen White’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Jeremy Allen White</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 17th of February 1991</li><li><strong>Jeremy Allen White’s Age:</strong> 30 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> A mix of Ukrainian, Scottish, English, German, Scots-Irish/Northern Irish, including a distant Dutch</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Aquarius</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Jeremy Allen White’s Husband (Wife):</strong> Addison Timlin</li><li><strong>Jeremy Allen White’s Children:</strong> Ezer Billie White and Dolores Wild White</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> One</li><li><strong>Jeremy Allen White’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 7 inches</li><li><strong>Jeremy Allen White’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 170 cm</li><li><strong>Jeremy Allen White’s Height in Metres:</strong> 1.7 m</li><li><strong>Jeremy Allen White’s Weight:</strong> 82 KG</li><li><strong>Body measurements in Inches:</strong> 39-31-14</li><li><strong>Body measurements in Centimetres:</strong> 99-78-35</li><li><strong>Eye color:</strong> Blue</li><li><strong>Hair Clor:</strong> brown</li><li><strong>Distinctive features:</strong> Sparkling blue eyes and slightly curly hair</li><li><strong>Shoe Size:</strong> 8 US</li></ul><h2><strong>How Tall is Jeremy Allen White?</strong></h2><p>Jeremy Allen White stands at an average height of 5 feet 7 inches or 170cm. The American movie star, who was born on the 17th of February 1991, is considered to be slightly shorter than the average height for an adult male in the US.</p><h2><strong>Jeremy Allen White’s Height Compared to His Shameless Co-stars</strong></h2><p>The American movie and TV actor came to public attention after he starred in the long-running Showtime series Shameless as Phillip “Lip” Gallagher. Since he joined one of the most-watched shows on television, fans have been asking to know whether he is the tallest among its cast members.</p><p>In response to the above question, Jeremy Allen White is not the series’ tallest cast member. His 5 feet 7 inches height places him at a disadvantage to at least one cast member, but that does not make him the shortest. Jeremy dwarfs some cast of Shameless, and there are quite a few that are in the same height department as him.</p><h3><strong>Jeremy Allen White Vs. Cameron Monaghan</strong></h3><p>Before he auditioned for the ”Lip” role in Shameless, Jeremy was previously gunning for the role of Ian Gallagher, but unfortunately, it was given to a much taller guy, Cameron Monaghan.</p><p>Born on the 16th of August, 1993, Cameron stands at the height of 5 feet 8 inches which is equivalent to 1.78 m. He is obviously an inch taller than Jeremy. The 30-year-old movie and television actor balances his height on a body mass of 69 kg, 13 kg less than Jeremy’s weight.</p><h3><strong>Noel Fisher’s Height Compared to Jeremy’s</strong></h3><p>The role of Mickey Milkovich in Shameless was essayed by the Canadian movie star Noel Fisher whose height is listed as 5 feet 7 inches or 170.2 cm. Noel, who was born on the 13th of March 1984, is obviously at the same height as Jeremy but weighs lower at 55 kg.</p><h3><strong>Who is Taller Between Jeremy Allen White and Emma Kenney?</strong></h3><p>American actress Emma Kenney was the one who portrayed the character of Debbie Gallagher in Shameless, and according to reports, she is also in the same height department as Jeremy at 5 feet 7 inches or 1.7 meters. Emma Rose Kenney, as her full name says, was born on September 14, 1999, and the 24-year-old weighs a commensurate 55 kg.</p><h3><strong>Emma Greenwell is Shorter Than Jeremy White by an Inch</strong></h3><p>5 feet 6 inches tall, Emma Greenwell breathed life into the character of Mandy Milkovichon on the set of Shameless, and from what is obvious, she is the only major cast member that is shorter than Jeremy by just one inch.</p><p>Greenwell, who was born on January 14th, 1989, weighs 53 kg to go with her average height.</p><p>With all these said, we must acknowledge the fact that Jeremy Allen White’s height and stature do not affect his natural ability to showcase his acting prowess on screen. It is true that height may detect the type of roles an actor is likely to get, but Jeremy’s charisma and inborn skills have led him to build a thriving career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Talking about Jeremy’s portrayal of the ”Lip” role in Shameless, the actor’s height hasn’t been a major issue, as the character’s personality did a good job of overshadowing any physical attributes.</p><h2><strong>Jeremy Allen White’s Body Measurements</strong></h2><p>White weighs a corresponding 82kg or 181 lbs which places him at an average build, but he is quite athletic with his physique. Apart from his body mass, the actor’s general body measurements are summarized as 39-31-14. While 39 inches is for the chest, 31 inches and 14 inches are for the waist and biceps, respectively.</p><p>Naturally, Jeremy is blessed with light brown hair. However, the Shameless star prefers to tint his hair with a darker shade of brown. His eyes are blue in color, and he wears a shoe size of 8 US.</p><p>On set, Jeremy often stands out thanks to his sparkling blue eyes and his hair, which appears to be a bit curly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/04/download-1-3-e1681899220469.jpg><h2><strong>A Look at the Actor’s Workout Routine&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Everyone knows that Jeremy Allen White has always had a decent physic which he maintains through dancing as he is an expert in ballet, jazz, and tap dancing.</p><p>In recent times, the New Yorker was cast to play the role of Kerry Von Erich in the film, The Iron Claw, which required him to add an extra 40 pounds with a lot of muscle gain in both shoulders and arms. Needless to say, this magnitude of muscle gain cannot be achieved through dancing alone; thus, Jeremy started lifting weights to get his body into shape for his upcoming role.</p><p>When quizzed about his gyming routine, the New York-born actor said he discovered a park equipped with an outdoor gym in his vicinity and has been leveraging the facility to workout.</p><p>Jeremy said he would do some rope jumps, push-ups, pull-ups, dips, and many more. The kind of body he is striving to have also calls for some heavy weightlifting, and Jeremy said he is getting enough of that through the gym. Talking about his experience at the outdoor gym, the Shameless actor said he is constantly meeting tougher people at the facility, and this gingers the competitive spirit in him, and he ends up training harder to surpass them.</p><h3><strong>Below is a rundown of Jeremy Allen White’s workout routine</strong></h3><ul><li>Alternating between bodyweight and weightlifting exercises</li><li>Performing compound exercises focusing on multiple muscle groups simultaneously (these include – bench presses, pull-ups, push-ups, dips, deadlifts, and more)</li><li>Lifting heavy and at the same time minimizing rep count (a weight where one can barely do eight reps per set)</li><li>Leveraging jump rope for cardio.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLemvsSmsGaZnKGyr3nWoaCtnV2dsqqzx61koaenYsGiuMtmoKxlpJ2ybq3Mnqmim5GjeqKv06ipaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jacob-sartorius-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jacob Sartorius Net Worth Reveal | Millie Bobby Brown, Music/YouTube/Instagram Earnings, Income Sour</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vote-from-a-bills-supporter-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Vote from a bill's supporter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-todd-chrisley-gay-everything-about-his-sexuality.html>Is Todd Chrisley Gay?
